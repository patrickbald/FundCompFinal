Final Project

This project displays a real-time visual of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm working its way through a weighted matrix. The weighted matrix essentially represents the simple graph that the algorithm traverses. Each time the algorithm is run, a new set of weights on put on the board. 

To run the animation, initially press space when the program first starts. Once the board is drawn out, enter 4 integers from 0-7 as the coordinates for where you want to start and end, such as 0077, which maps to coordinates (0,0) for start, and (7,7) for end. Once the animation is complete, you may press space to run the program again or press 'q' to exit the program.

i.e, the sequence: space 0077 space 2356 space 1267, q will run the program 3 times.  

The pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm was found on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-using-priority_queue-stl/
